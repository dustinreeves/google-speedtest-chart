1. Copy the spreadsheet key from the URL into your `config.json`.

  `/usr/local/bin/speedtest-to-google`
1. Yep, it works:

1. Setup a cronjob so the speedtest runs automatically:  
  `crontab -e`  

  and insert:

  `*/10 * * * * PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/speedtest-to-google`
  ^just fyi, in ubuntu, i had to define my path as an absolute, for whatever reason, the $PATH variable would not play nice.?
  so i basically echo'd $PATH, and then put the contents in front of my :/usr/local/bin
  

  Save and quit using Ctrl + X.
1. Now back in the spreadsheet, select the whole columns A - D by clicking on A, then with Shift + Click on D:
